App Idea 1: Mood Matcher
-
What: Mood Matcher is an app that is designed to give music or movie suggestions based on a selected mood.
Who: This app is targeted to both music and movie lovers who want to find new songs/movies based on whatever particular mood they're in. 
Why: I want to create this app to provide people with an interesting and fun way to discover new music to listen to or new movies to watch.
Challenges: the biggest challenges may be using two API's, one for movies and one for films and being able to filter those results accurately according to the users preferences. It may also be difficult deciding if I should design the app in a way where the user selects what mood they want or if I should create a filter option. 

App Idea 2: ChartsChecker
-
What: Displays top songs/artists/albums based on selected country or year. 
Who: This app will be for anyone interested in music and likes to check statistics for years.
Why: Because sometimes its fun to randomly check statistics for music for particular years or see where your favorite artist placed at a paricular point in time. 
Challenges: some challenges may be displaying the statistics in a way thats readable and easy to navigate.
